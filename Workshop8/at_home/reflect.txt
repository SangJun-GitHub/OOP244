1. What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?
The difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class is the level of implementation. A concrete class is a class that can be used to create an object. An abstract class cannot be used to create an object. the concrete class is like a "stamp" which we can make a cookie with that stamper. An abstract class is like a blueprint for the stamper. We can make cookies with only blueprint of stamper.

2. Identify the functions that shadow functions of the same name in your solution?
In my code, display, monthEnd, credit, and debit functions shadowed. Because I defined virtual functions in "iAccount.h", It postpones the compiler search function from compile-time to run-time. when the program running time, the program identify the most fittable function with parameters.

3. Explain what have you learned in this workshop.
I learned inheritance, pure virtual classes, abstract and base classes through this workshop. Additionally, I learned how to reduce duplication of codes.
