1.What happens if you try to put your templated functions in Data.cpp? Does your source code compile if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain.
Basically, it works
However, templates need to be instantiate by compiler before compiling them into the object code.

2.Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now? Do you need to define the template function above main(), before it is used, or can you define it below main()?
Both cases are not working.
because of same reason to above. Also, these cases are out of namespace. So, the compiler cannot find template functions at compile time.

3.Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading your functions in Data.h to accept integer and double arguments? What is the advantage of using templates? 
Yes, I can finish without template functions. However, when I did this workshop, there are used same logic but different types. So, template functions are good for reducing duplication and for making my code shorter and more effective.

4.Are the following equivalent? 
template<class T> 
template<typename T> 
Both are same.
