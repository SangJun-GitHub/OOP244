1.What is a namespace? Explain its purpose.
The namespace encloses variables, contents to use that within each namespace.
Even if different programmers use same identifiers, the namespace prevents conflict of same identifiers.

2.Why are header files needed? Explain.
A header file is a file containing declarations and contents to be shared between several source files.

3.In the instructions above, you were directed to compile only .cpp files but not the .h files. Explain why you should never compile header files.
Generally, a header file is contained declarations that can be safely run in different source files. 
If we compile a header file, it makes slow when we compile our program. So, it is not necessary.

4.Explain why you should never include .cpp files in another file.
A program does not have a problem with the small code, but if a code will be bigger when we compile we spend a lot of times. 
It removes advantage when we separate our code.

5.Explain in your own words what have you learned on this workshop.
I learned how to separate full code for cohesion and coupling. 
Also, I learned safeguards for header file which is when we compile a code with reduplication of declarations. 
Finally, I could study C++ code with that workshop.


Quiz X Reflection: 
this week, we did not take a quiz.
